1. App accepts only data without spaces and special characters. Enhance this.
2. While loading ll84 populate `No` instead of `blanks` for city building.

#Questions to Alejandro/ Miles
##Space Use - Occupancy Grp mapping
1. MedicalOffice maps to both B-AmbulatoryHealth and B-Business. which one should I use ?
2. I do not see carbon limits for occupancy groups like R1-residential. Does that mean we do not care about these groups ?
